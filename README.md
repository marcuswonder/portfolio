# Marcus Smith's Portfolio

<br>

I wanted to create a place to present my professional accreditation as well as to capture memories and projects from my personal life. I used this duality to inform the design of my site, where the user can switch between a more austere header image with professional information to a more playful header that contains personal information.

My other main objective when building the site was to try and test out whether I could build a responsive single page site using HTML, CSS and Javascript only.

## Styling
It was important to me to keep both the professional and personal side of my life available, but to have them clearly different. I have started this process with the header image, but I do hope to further accentuate the different sides of the website in due course.

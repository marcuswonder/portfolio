                <p class="p">I am an established professional with skills in full-stack web-development, business strategy and management. My professional experiences include working in event-planning, with charities, with investors and most recently in founding a professional skills training business in Sierra Leone. 
                    <br><br>
                    This breadth of experience, both as an employee and a business owner, has exposed me to a wide variety of challenges and problems which I have relished solving. I am looking forward to deploying my recent software engineering training by leveraging my experience and skills in a new, more technical environment.</p>

                <p class="p">I try and live my life to the max - never shying away from challenges and opportunities. In 2023 I got married to the wonderful Kristie - the latest in a series of adventures!
                    <br><br>
                    I've been lucky enough to live abroad and experience life in different parts of the world which has only fueled my desire to see more. Whether I'm living in a developing country or at home in London, I always try to explore everything with an open-minded approach.
                    <br><br>
                    When I'm not planning my next trip, you'll probably find me at a gig or festival, dancing like nobody's watching. Life's too short to take everything too seriously, so I try to have as much fun as possible along the way. Let's go on an adventure together!"</p>

                            <p class="card-text">I have had the pleasure of working with Marcus for over 8 years and I can wholeheartedly attest to his exceptional ability, positive attitude, and unwavering dedication to his work.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Throughout his career, Marcus has impressively managed a wide variety of projects and roles across different organisations, consistently demonstrating resilience and leadership in the face of challenging environments and circumstances. He particularly excels in his ability to lead strategic planning, cultivate positive cultures, and drive meaningful outcomes, making him an invaluable asset to any team. He has been able to build a complex solution from concept to implementation on several occasions – an impressive skill that is not easily replicated.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">One of Marcus' greatest strengths is his strategic problem-solving ability. He approaches complex issues with thoughtfulness and determination, consistently achieving positive results. As an employer, manager, and co-founder, I have always been impressed by his willingness to go above and beyond to ensure the success of his team and the organisation as a whole.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">I am confident that Marcus will bring immense value to any organisation with whom he chooses to work. I wholeheartedly recommend him without hesitation and have no doubt that he will continue to excel in any role he takes on.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Marcus was critical in managing the merger of four businesses into the LBD Group. As Chief Delivery Officer he was responsible for structuring the group-wide Operations, Finance and HR departments, and for designing and implementing of financial, project-management and performance-management systems and processes that I could use as CEO to manage the teams and run the business. </p>
                            <p class="card-text">Marcus’ strengths lie in his ability to design, implement and train staff on tools to strengthen business processes. We are still using the financial and performance-management tools that he built for us!</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Marcus demonstrated his commitment to the success of the LBD Group through dedicated, passionate hard work. He was well liked amongst the staff and continues to support my teams in an advisory capacity to this day.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Overall, we were very sad to see Marcus go and we continue to explore ways in which we can work together closely in the future.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Grow Salone is a company in Sierra Leone supporting young people in the early stages of their career and organisations seeking to upgrade the capacity of their staff. They do this through their Professional and Modular Skills Programmes by providing world-class training, recruitment and performance management services. In my first year of employment, Marcus Smith was my supervisor and the Managing Director of Grow Salone. Marcus displayed reliable and consistent work ethics. You can always count on him to deliver work on time, and to provide the necessary support needed by the Team to complete tasks and meet deadlines. He was often the handyman, the troubleshooter-he was always taking the initiative. It was easy to stay motivated and productive when working with Marcus because he was result driven, always bringing positive energy to the team. I was often amazed at the high level of professionalism he displayed. Marcus was respectful, always ready to listen to the ideas of others and encouraged high quality work. He displayed exemplary productivity and integrity which was emulated by team members.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">I was recently promoted because of my impressive work ethics. I attribute my success to Marcus who taught me how to be a leader that inspires the trust and commitment of others.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Marcus had an unmatched drive for delivering results, yet he always prioritized staff wellbeing. The long hours and quality of work he gave to work was inspiration to all of the teams.</p>    
                            <p class="card-text">I achieved some of my best in terms of professional growth working under Marcus's supervision at Grow Salone where I worked as Trainer and later Lead Trainer. He empowers you to take ownership of your role. For instance, during one of my performance review sessions with him, he asked me "Is there anything I can do to get out of your way [so you can take increased leadership of the training team]?"</p>    
                            <p class="card-text">Marcus has a gift for automating processes to drive efficiency and scalability. At EducAid (where I worked as School Leader and Teacher Training Programme Coordinator he built M&E systems that transformed our ability to make informed decisions about students, with intuitive dashboards and user interfaces. His team also visited the schools to monitor system usage, train staff in using the system and resolving issues based on their experience using it. His desire to automate processes made us highly efficient and made new staff onboarding seamless.</p>

            <br><br>
            <p class="p text-dark">In February of 2019 I secured funding to build a company that would seek to bridge the skills gap between university and the workplace by providing world-class skills training and career-development support. In the course of 3.5 years we developed a proprietary curriculum, grading and reporting system and graduated more than 80 students with an 85% employment rate within 6 months.</p>
            <p class="p text-dark">As well as supporting individuals, we worked with major international partners to deliver on educational objectives within Sierra Leone.</p>
            <p class="p text-dark">In mid-2022 we exited Grow Salone by completing its sale into a larger, merged business services group, the <a href="https://lbd.group/" target="_blank">LBD Group</a>.</p>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Grow Salone was founded to provide world-class educational services in Sierra Leone, with the specific objective of providing skills that would drive productivity, efficiency and dynamism within the workforce.</p>
            <p>The Professional Skills Programme is Grow Salone's flagship course, designed specifically to support entry-level jobseekers into the workplace with the skills to add value to their employers from day one. Our innovative financing and post-graduation support model allowed Grow Salone to invest in their graduates, and to align their careers with the company's commercial performance.</p>
            <p>Grow Salone's commercial partners have sought them to design and implement a range of high-quality educational programmes, from in-service training to interactive e-learning design; Grow Salone has worked with some of the best known institutions within Sierra Leone and across global development.</p>

                    <p>Throughout the programme, we collect more than 2,500 individual pieces of data on each graduate. Using Google Classroom and Sheets, I developed a grading and Skills Reporting system which allowed us to serve this information to our employment partners in a digestible format.</p>

            <h4 class="h4 text-dark">An incredible charity that I feel lucky to have worked for.</h4>
            <br><br>
            <p class="p text-dark">EducAid operates residential schools for the most needy children in Sierra Leone, regularly achieving some of the nation's highest grades in public exams.</p>
            <p class="p text-dark">EducAid also supports government schools through teacher training programmes that cover academics, holistic learning and positive learning management.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="p text-dark">I haven't completed this section yet, but I will briefly summarise the projects that I was involved in below:</p>

                        <h4 class="card-title">Donor Management System</h4>
                        <p class="card-text">This was the first of many systems that I built for EducAid. I processed 15 years of donor data and developed a CRM system to track monthly donations, generate fundraising reminders and provide insights on fundraising event conversion and efficiency.</p>

                        <h4 class="card-title">Student Tracking Report</h4>
                        <p class="card-text">Using Google Sheets, I built and deployed a student tracking system across >3000 students at 11 schools in 5 districts in one of the lowest-resourced countries in the world. The report gathers dozens of pieces of data per student and reports efficiency by school, class and tutor group. This system is still in use today, nearly 5 years after I left EducAid.</p>

                        <h4 class="card-title">HR Review</h4>
                        <p class="card-text">When I first travelled to Sierra Leone, I was asked to conduct a thorough review of the HR systems and processes; later I was asked to implement those reforms. These included a top-to-bottom review of roles and responsibilities, a revised payroll system and introduction of a functional performance-management system.<p>
